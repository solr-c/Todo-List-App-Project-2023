Project's Title:
React & TypeScript Todo List

Project Description:
This personal project serves as both a practical tool for managing daily tasks and a learning endeavor into the React ecosystem and TypeScript language. The application allows users to add, view, and manage tasks with ease. Initially built as a simple todo list, the vision is to evolve it into a comprehensive routine tracker.

Current Features:

- Task Entry: Users can enter tasks they need to accomplish.
- Task Completion: Users can mark tasks as complete.
- Task Deletion: Users can delete tasks from the list.
- Empty State: The project indicates when there are no tasks present.

The application's functionality is centered around creating and managing a list of tasks, providing a clear and interactive interface to mark tasks as complete and delete them. The intent is to expand this to include routine tracking features, allowing for a more structured approach to managing daily and weekly habits.

Challenges Faced:
One of the primary challenges was gaining proficiency with TypeScript's static typing, which introduced a learning curve to managing component state and props in React.

Another challenge involved setting up a scalable state management system that could accommodate the application's growth from a simple todo list to a more complex routine tracker.

This project is a platform for learning and the features will be added progressively, and to gain a understanding of React and TypeScript.
